# Angular MVP (placeholder)

This package will host a minimal Angular app mirroring the vanilla demo (Home, Financial Aid, Graduate Programs, Undergraduate Programs, Contact) for UI kit testing.

Planned tooling:
- Angular CLI (ng)
- Build: `ng build` → `dist/angular-mvp/`
- Netlify base: `apps/angular`

Not yet scaffolded — we’ll generate with Angular CLI in a follow-up to avoid committing excessive boilerplate.
